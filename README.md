# Mini Project Alice in Wonderland

In the context of the curricular unit of Multimedia in Artistic Environments (MAA), the students were challenged to develop a mini project inspired in the work "Alice in Wonderland", using the technologies learned so far during the practical classes. The story of Alice in Wonderland is known by most people, being a timeless tale full of symbolism. 

Thus, the idea developed, besides being inspired by the Alice narrative, intended to make a representation of madness, which is portrayed through the Mad Hatter character. It is important to mention that this idea is more present in the character's room. The setting built was inspired by the chapter in the book where he first appears, entitled "A mad tea party". Inside, there is a forest with a table full of food, teas and other objects allusive to the moment. 

In addition, the group decided to introduce the Hatter's room where the objects were arranged in an abnormal way. This does not exist in the original narrative, and has become an innovative and curious element. Besides the objects, the user is accompanied by sounds that become stronger and more disturbing when one enters the room and the door closes, like whispers. 

In terms of ambient light, the group decided that the forest would be illuminated as if it were afternoon, transmitting the sensation of a calmer climate. In contrast, the room would have a darker interior associated with the darkness that madness can bring to certain people. 

Additionally, at the end of the experiment, it was decided to put the forest in night tones to give the idea that, inside the Hatter's room, time moves faster than outside.
